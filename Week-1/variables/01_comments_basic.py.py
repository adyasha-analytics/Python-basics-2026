# Topic: Python comments
#Purpose: Lrearn how to explain code clearly
#_______________________________________________

#This is a single line comment 
#Comments are ignored by python
#they are Written for human, not machines
#_______________________________________________
#Example 1: Comment before a line of code
#_______________________________________________

age = 18 #This varible stores age in years 
print(age) # Print the value of age

#________________________________________________
#Example 2: Explaing logic with comments
#________________________________________________

# Assining two numbers
a = 10
b = 5

#Adding the numbers
sum = a + b

#Printing the result
print(sum)

#__________________________________________________
#Example 3: Why comments matter
#__________________________________________________

#Without comments, code is hard to understand later
#With comments, anyone can read and maintain it

name = "Adyasha" #Stores the user's name
student = True #Boolen variable

print(name)
print(student)

#____________________________________________________
#Notes:
# - Use comments to explain WHY , not WHAT 
# - Avoid obious comments in real projects
# - Good comments = professional code
